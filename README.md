# Java Pattern Programs

🚀 Java DSA Practice

I have recently started learning Java, and this repository is created to store my practice code while learning Java along with basic DSA concepts.

The repository will be updated regularly as I learn new topics and practice more problems.
All programs are written in a beginner-friendly way with simple logic and comments to understand concepts clearly.

Java Basics (input/output, variables, syntax)

Conditional Statements (if-else, switch)

Loops and pattern programs

Arrays (basic operations)
